The KNewStuff library adds data sharing capabilities to KDE applications.
Technically, it implements the Get Hot New Stuff (GHNS) and DXS specifications.

There are standalone applications for Get Hot New Stuff in kdebase/runtime/knewstuff.
These should get you started together with techbase.kde.org where tutorials can be found.
