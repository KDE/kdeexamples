What is it?
KDE Window Manager, KWin, supports scripting now. It means that you can write
special rules in order to do something you want with windows when an event occurs.
For example, when a new Kopete window opens, this script adds it to the same group as
the previous opened one.


How do I install it?
At first, make sure that your KWin installation supports scripting. Then, copy this
script to $HOME/.kde/local/apps/kwin/scripts/ (on some systems it will be ".kde4") and make executable (chmod a+x kopete.kwinscript). Then you should set environment variable KWINSCRIPTS to that folder. Assuming, you are using Bourne-Again Shell, execute:

echo "export KWINSCRIPTS=$HOME/.kde/local/apps/kwin/scripts/" >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc

And then restart KWin with "kwin --replace &" command.


Script idea
We define two variables at lines 18 and 19: first one (kopeteGroupCount) is used to
count Kopete windows that are present in the group; second one defines the window group itself. Variable c (line 22) stores all windows (possibly including Kopete' ones). Then
(line 24) we loop over it to find those which window class is equal to "Kopete" (line 27). If it's so, we check, if there are any windows in group (line 28).
If there is no, we create a new group and add Kopete's window to it (lines 28-29). If there are some windows in the group, we add the window to the same group (lines 30-31). Then we increase the windows' counter (line 33).
There are also two events: adding a new window and removing an existent one. Adding (lines 39-49) window event's response is implemented in the same way as the first initialization. On Kopete's window removing (lines 52-57), we just decrease the counter (line 55).


Where can I get more information on scripting?
You can study the API here(http://rohanprabhu.com/files/kwsapi.html) or
have a look at tutorial (http://rohanprabhu.com/?p=116). Of course, you
can also take a look at kwin's sources ("scripting" dir).
