KPart technology is used in KDE to reuse GUI components. The advantage that a KPart presents
is that it comes with predefined toolbar actions. By using kparts in applications developers
can spend less time implementing text editor or command line features, for example and just
use a katepart or a konsolepart instead.

This example is a simple editor done by loading a KatePart.
